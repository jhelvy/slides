Hi everyone, my name is John Paul Helveston and I want to talk

about solutions to keep our hands happy and healthy

## **I type ~7 million key strokes per year**

<center>
<img src="images/monthlyKeys.png" width=700>
</center>

???

In 2020 I typed 7.5 million key strokes, and if you're a

regular R user like me, chances are you too are racking up

some serious mileage on your keyboard, which can lead to pain

and serious injury. So today I want to talk about some tools

and suggestions to take better care of your hands while typing.

# **Tip #1**: Practice Touch Typing

## https://www.keybr.com/

<center>
<img src="images/qwerty.png" width=700>
</center>

???

My first suggestion is simply to practice your typing.

I thought I had pretty good typing skills, but I found I was

able to increase my speed and accuracy by about 20% with just

two months of daily practice on on key-br-dot-com. So, take some

time to work on your typing, most people can benefit from it.

# **Tip #2:** Use a text expander like _espanso_

<center>
<img src="images/personal.gif" width=800>
</center>

See my post on espanso at <a href="https://www.jhelvy.com/blog">https://www.jhelvy.com/blog</a>
</center>

???

You can also create your own shortcuts by using a text expander,

which are programs that convert keywords into text snippets.

In the example on the left, I'm using some custom expansions to

write some ggplot code for a scatterplot. And on the right, I'm

using a single keyword to generate a code chunk that I use in most

of my RMarkdown files. My favorite expander is an open source one

called espanso, if you want to learn more at it, you can check out

my blog post about it on my website at jhelvy.com.

# **Tip #3:** Use custom keyboard layers

<br>

<br>
ZXCVBNM<>?
</p>
</center>

???

Another tip is to use custom keyboard layers. Every keyboard has

at least two layers: the base layer of numbers and lower case letters,

and another layer of symbols and upper case letters when you hold "shift".

# **Tip #3:** Use custom keyboard layers

<center>
<img src="images/keyboard_nav_layer.png" width=1000>
</center>

???

A nice solution is to use a custom layer to move these keys back

to a more convenient location.

# Example: **Caps Lock Layer**

<center>
<img src="images/keyboard_remap.png" width=1100>
</center>

???

For example, on my keyboard, I re-mapped my caps lock key to

trigger a new layer that has the navigation arrows and forward and back

delete under my right hand, and cut, copy, paste under my left hand.

I implemented this using a program called Karabiner Elements, which is

for mac only, but on Windows most people use a similar program called

Auto-hot-key.

# **Tip #4:** Use a split keyboard

<center>
<img src="images/ergo_split_basic.jpg" width=650>
</center>

???

In addition to all these software tools, I highly recommend using

some kind of a split keyboard.

# Think of your keyboard as a medical device

]

.cols3[

<center>
<img src="images/glasses.jpg" width=350>
Average cost of glasses<br><b>$242.00</b>
</center>

]

???

Now one of the downsides to split keyboards is that they can be more

expensive, though there are plenty of great options for around $100.

But I encourage to consider your keyboard as a medical device, like a

pair of glasses, which can easily cost over $100. Without glasses,

I couldn't read my own code, but without a keyboard I couldn't type it.

Investing in a good keyboard is an investment in the health of your hands,

wrists, and shoulders.

# Build Your Keyboard With Open Source Tools!

Iris (~$200.00), Powered by <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK Firmware</a>
</center>

???

The Ergodox in particular is rather expensive, but if you're feeling ambitious

you can build your own for a lot less. There's actually a pretty big community

of keyboard hobbiest, and building your own keyboard these days is actually

rather straightforward. Keyboards like the Iris shown here can be snapped

together like a set of legos.

# Use a split keyboard **_that is programmable_**

<center>
<img src="images/ergodox_layout.png" width=670>
</center>

???

Finally, if you are going to invest in a good keyboard, get one that is fully

programmable. This enables you to implement many of the solutions I mentioned,

like custom layers, directly into the keyboard itself.
