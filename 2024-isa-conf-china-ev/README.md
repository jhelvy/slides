**Title**

The Rise of Chinese Leadership in the Plug-in Electric Vehicle Industry

**Abstract**

China is the world's largest market for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), comprising approximately half of all PEVs sold worldwide. Chinese firms also dominate China's domestic PEV market, with Tesla being the only foreign competitor able to obtain an appreciable share of the market. This outcome is the result of multiple factors that have occurred over multiple decades, including a series of strategic industrial policies going back to the 1980s as well as how those policies interacted with China's unique institutional environment. Combined with favorable market conditions, rapid infrastructure construction, and the ambition of innovative Chinese firms, China's PEV industry has rapidly evolved to become a world-leading market. This paper chronicles these various factors and discusses some implications for the future of China's PEV industry and it's position as the central node in the global PEV supply chain.
