# Practice Question 1

Consider the following experiment design

<div style="width:200px">
a | b | c | Effect
--|---|---|-------
+ | - | - | A
- | + | - | B 
+ | - | + | AC 
- | + | + | BC 
</div>

a) Is the design balanced? Is is orthogonal?

- Balanced: YES 
- Othogonal: NO

Check: 

```{r}
doe <- tribble(
    ~a, ~b, ~c,
     1,  0,  0,  
     0,  1,  0, 
     1,  0,  1, 
     0,  1,  1
)

# Check balance
doe %>% count(a)
doe %>% count(b)
doe %>% count(c)

# Check orthogonal
pairs <- doe %>% 
    mutate(
        ab = ifelse(a == b, 1, 0),
        bc = ifelse(b == c, 1, 0),
        ac = ifelse(a == c, 1, 0),
    )

pairs %>% count(ab)
pairs %>% count(bc)
pairs %>% count(ac)
```

The design is NOT orthogonal because A is always equal to -B.

b) Write out the equation to compute the main effect for a, b, and c. 

$$
ME(a) = \frac{A + AC}{2} - \frac{B + BC}{2}
$$

$$
ME(b) = \frac{B + BC}{2} - \frac{A + AC}{2}
$$

$$
ME(c) = \frac{AC + BC}{2} - \frac{A + B}{2}
$$

c) Are any main effects confounded? If so, what are they confounded with?

In this design, A and B are confounded (A = -B)

To find other confounded effects, multiply the remaining effects by (a = -b): 

- b(a = -b) --> ab = -I
- c(a = -b) --> ac = -bc
- ab(a = -b) --> b = -a
- ac(a = -b) --> c = -abc 
- bc(a = -b) --> abc = -c
- abc(a = -b) --> bc = -ac
